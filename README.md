# Drag and Drop
I wanted to add drag and drop feature to my Todo App without using a library. It was challenging to sort items but it was a fun challenge to do.

## What I Learned
- I got familiar with HTML Drag and Drop API

## Continued Development
- When an item is being dragged, I'd like to add a transition/animation for other items.
- Make it mobile/touch friendly

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
